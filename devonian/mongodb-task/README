* Operation

There are three predefined files in the  /opt/service  dir:    start.sh,  setup.sh  and  
healthcheck.sh .  
  start.sh  starts the server.  It checks the mounted data volume and initializes it if needed; 
creates the server configuration file in accordance with the environment (net, users, resource 
dir).  It also invokes  setup.sh  exactly once, during the first start of the container.  
  setup.sh  creates the middleware user and executes the neccessary chowns according to the 
environment variables.
